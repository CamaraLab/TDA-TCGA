Description: TDA.TCGA is a pipeline for identifying candidate driver mutations and genetic alterations in 
    cancer from transcriptomic and genetic data. TDA.TCGA constructs a network representation of the
    expression subspace using TDAMapper, implements controls for spurious correlations between gene
    expression and mutation, and assesses localization of genetic alterations using RayleighSelection.
